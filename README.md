# NYC Traffic Data Project ðŸš¦

This is a small project where I explored live traffic data in New York City using the TomTom API.  
The goal was to practice working with APIs, cleaning the data in pandas, and creating a simple visualization.

## What I did
- Pulled real-time traffic data for a few well-known NYC spots (like Times Square and Wall Street)
- Stored the results in a pandas DataFrame
- Compared current speeds with free-flow speeds to see congestion levels
- Plotted the points on an interactive map with Folium

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, requests, folium

## Preview

Hereâ€™s a preview of the traffic map:

## Why this project
I wanted to build something small but practical that shows I can:
1. Work with APIs
2. Handle data in Python
3. Make results more visual and easy to understand

## Next steps
Iâ€™d like to expand this project by:
- Adding more locations
- Automating updates so the data refreshes in real time
